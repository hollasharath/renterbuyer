## Points to note
1. The 10,000 users are generated in a sequential manner. They can also be generated parallely. Its just a random decision taken
2. Not much thought has gone into aesthetics. 
3. There are lot of things like testing, display of errors, etc which have not been done. If production level of completeness was expected, please let me know. I'll spend more time on this.
